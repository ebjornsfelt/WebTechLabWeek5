<h1>Home!</h1>

<p>
    In July I celebrated my <strong>birthday</strong> and got a macbook pro as a gift for my birthday present. Other than my birthday I spent a lot of time with friends and playing
    video games with them. July was basically uneventful other than my birthday.

Something that I dislike is when people chew with their mouth open.
I feel that this is <em>very inconsiderate and very rude.</em>
One of my friends purposely does it everytime he eats in our discord calls. He's the worst.
