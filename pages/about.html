        In July I celebrated my <strong>birthday</strong> and got a macbook pro as a gift for my birthday present. Other than my birthday I spent a lot of time with friends and playing
        video games with them. July was basically uneventful other than my birthday.

        Something that I dislike is when people chew with their mouth open.
        I feel that this is <em>very inconsiderate and very rude.</em>
        One of my friends purposely does it everytime he eats in our discord calls. He's the worst.
        I also very much dislike it when it's too hot outside, for example this July when it was 40 degrees.
        When it is too hot there's almost nothing you can do about it unless you buy an air conditioner.
        Funny thing is I knew the heat wave was coming and bought an AC the week before - it was working great,
        then the day before the heat wave hits, the AC breaks and I'm stuck boiling in heat.
